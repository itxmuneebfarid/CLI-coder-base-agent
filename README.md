# CLI Coder-Based Agent
The CLI Coder-Based Agent is a terminal-based AI assistant designed for developers who want quick, keyboard-first coding help without leaving the command line.
It can:

Answer coding questions

Provide debugging suggestions

Explain code snippets

Automate small code generation tasks

This tool is lightweight, works across platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS), and supports three modes of use:

Interactive Mode – continuous conversation with the AI agent.

Single Query Mode – process a single coding question instantly.

File Mode – read a prompt from a .txt file and process it.

By embedding an AI backend (loaded via load_agent() from agent.py), it provides intelligent responses directly in the CLI — making it especially useful for developers working over SSH or in minimal environments.

Example main.py usage snippets
Interactive: displays ASCII banner and colors (if colorama installed), keeps a loop until quit|exit|q.

Multi-Agent Support

Switch between different AI backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI, Local LLMs) via CLI flags
# Conclusion
The CLI Coder-Based Agent is a robust, flexible, and user-friendly AI assistant designed for terminal enthusiasts and developers.
Its modular architecture, multiple modes, and focus on speed make it well-suited for:

Quick coding help

Script automation

AI-assisted development workflows

By keeping dependencies minimal and the interface intuitive, it offers a practical balance between power and simplicity.
