#Project Report â€“ AI-Powered Coder Agent CLI
1. Project Overview
The AI-Powered Coder Agent CLI is a command-line interface tool designed to allow developers to interact with an AI coding assistant directly from the terminal.
It supports:

Interactive mode for back-and-forth conversations.

Single query mode for one-time AI responses.

File mode for reading prompts from files.

The tool is customizable, color-enhanced for better UX, and structured to support multiple operating systems.

2. Objectives
Provide developers with a fast, lightweight AI assistant without requiring a web interface.

Support multiple modes of operation for flexibility.

Enhance the terminal experience with colors, ASCII art, and clear session controls.

Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS).

3. Features
Modes of Operation
Interactive Mode (-i or default)

Starts a conversational session with the AI.

Supports commands: quit, exit, or q to end the session.

Displays a stylized welcome screen.

Single Query Mode

Allows direct AI responses from a one-line prompt.

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py "Explain Python decorators"
File Mode (-f file.txt)

Reads a query from a text file.

Processes the file content as the AI input.

Additional Features
Color Output using colorama (fallback to plain text if unavailable).

ASCII Art Welcome Banner for branding and user engagement.

Error Handling for missing files, keyboard interruptions, and invalid input.

Version Control with --version argument.

Cross-platform Screen Clear support.

4. Technical Implementation
Key Components
argparse: For command-line argument parsing.

colorama: For cross-platform color output.

agent.load_agent(): Loads the AI agent for prompt processing.

agent.invoke(): Sends user queries to the AI and returns results.

os & sys: For file handling, terminal control, and system exits.

Code Structure
Utility Functions

colored_print(): Unified function to print colored or plain text.

show_welcome(): Displays ASCII art and clears the terminal.

Modes

interactive_mode(): Handles continuous conversation.

single_query_mode(): Processes one query.

file_mode(): Reads and processes file-based prompts.

Entry Point

main(): Uses argparse to select the mode and run it.

5. User Guide
Run in Interactive Mode (Default)
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
or

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py -i
Run Single Query Mode
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py "What is recursion?"
Run File Mode
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py -f prompt.txt
Check Version
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py --version
6. Error Handling
Missing File: Displays a clear error message if the file does not exist.

Empty Input: Ignores and waits for valid input.

Keyboard Interrupt / EOF: Gracefully exits with a goodbye message.

Colorama Import Failure: Falls back to non-colored output.

7. Potential Enhancements
Command History (store and recall previous queries in interactive mode).

Logging (save queries and responses to a file).

Multiple File Processing (batch file queries).

Config File Support for setting default modes or styles.

Progress Indicators while AI processes requests.

8. Conclusion
The AI-Powered Coder Agent CLI is a robust, lightweight, and developer-friendly terminal-based AI tool. Its modular design, multi-mode support, and polished UI make it suitable for real-world coding assistance, educational use, and quick AI-powered development workflows.
